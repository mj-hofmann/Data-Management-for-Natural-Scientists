#
# 1) Read data

#
# 2) Visualize data --> how? try multiple options as we go

#
# 3) Get "state of the art" parameters

#
# 4) Get further characteristic parameters (time for following 
#    hunches ...)

#
# 5) Optional: fit theoretical model to data

#
# 6) "Pack" collected parameters and associate it with the sample
